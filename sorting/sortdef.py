Different type of sorting depend on as fallows:
space-->{space:Bubble Sort (doesnot require any extra space),
out of space:Merge sort(require extra space)}
stability-->
{
stable:insertion sort (doesnot require change of similar content),
unstable:Quick sort(require change of similar content)
}

sorting terminology-->   
increasing order(1,2,3,4,5,6,7),
 Decreasing order(8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1), 
 NonIncreasing  order(9,8,7,6,5,5,4,3,2,1)
 Non Decreasing Order (1,2,3,4,5,6,77,77,88)
